            <h3>Computers</h3>
            <p>
                I built my computer myself with a little help from youtube and it is currently the reason I am poor.
                I have poured around $1000 into that thing by now and the cpu is still a crappy old $80 6 core lol</p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>
                I have been coding in html, css, and javascript for about 5 years and I learned python 1 year ago although I don't use it anymore.  Coding has caputred my attention for a long time and I enjoy making new things like my <a href="projects/cookie-clicker-remake.html">Cookie Clicker Remake</a>, my <a href="projects/physics-simulator.html">Physics simulator</a>, and my <a href="projects/text-game.html">Text Game</a>.

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                Ever since I made that computer I have been getting really into steam and I have put way too much into games on there.
                <br>
                My favorite games include:

                    <li>No Hesi</li>
                    <li>Battlebit</li>
                    <li>BeamNG Drive</li>
                    <li>Dirt Rally 2.0</li>
                    <li>Skyrim</li>

            <h3>Rubik's Cubes</h3>
            <p>
                Back During Quarantine I was super bored so I learned how to solve Rubik's cubes and proceded to buy $200 worth of cubes and timers and lube.  The fastest time I ever got was a 48s.

            <h3>Butterfly Knives</h3>
            <p>
                I haven't gotten too far into these yet but they are very fun to pass the time, I don't use the real one I have very much because it scares me but learning new tricks gives me so much dopamine.

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>
                This isn't a current hobbie but it was for the bigger half of my life, I used to draw casually untill 2 years ago and it was a hobbie of mine for about 8 years.  I'm lazy so I dropped this one.
